                <h2>Doge</h2>
                <p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who
                    decided
                    to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the
                    time. Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin
                    features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake. It was
                    introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market
                    capitalization of US$85,314,347,523 on May 5, 2021.
                    Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the "fun and friendly internet currency", referencing its
                    origins
                    as a joke.

                <h2>Shiba Inu</h2>
                <p> SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building. SHIB token is our first token
                    and
                    allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them. Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this ERC-20
                    ONLY
                    token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively
                    speaking). Popular worldwide, and already up thousands of percent, Shiba token ($Shib) is the first
                    cryptocurrency token to be listed and incentivized on ShibaSwap, our decentralized exchange.
                    We locked the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys!
                    The remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path,
                    so
                    everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't
                    own
                    team tokens they can dump on the community.

                <h2>Pancake Swap</h2>
                <p> PancakeSwap token (CAKE) is a BEP-20 token that was launched on Binance Smart Chain, used in the
                    PancakeSwap ecosystem. CAKE aims to stimulate the liquidity provision to the PancakeSwap platform.
                    Holders of the coin can also stake it to earn rewards.

                    PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies and tokens
                    without an intermediary. The protocol is built on automated smart contracts on Binance Smart Chain,
                    the
                    blockchain run by centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance. PancakeSwap is not operated or
                    controlled
                    by Binance; the DEX, in fact, was built by anonymous developers. PancakeSwap is built on an
                    automated
                    market maker (AMM) system, which relies on user-fueled liquidity pools to enable crypto trades.
                    Users
                    lock their tokens into a liquidity pool via smart contracts. This way you’re able to make the swap
                    you
                    want, and users who provide their coins in the pool earn rewards.
